# Compact Names + Debug Mode

**Date:** 2026-06-19
**Status:** Approved

## Problem

Qualified node IDs (e.g. `orders.DomainModel.order.schemas.OrderItem`) appear in several places in the web UI — the type column, details/links column, and schema section headers. This is explicit but hurts readability for the normal browsing workflow. The full ID is useful for: manual file editing (escape hatch) and sharing context with Claude when debugging.

## Design

### Default (compact) mode

All places that currently show a qualified name display only the final/local segment instead:

| Location | Current | Compact |
|---|---|---|
| Type column (`fieldType`) | `orders.DomainModel.order.schemas.OrderItem` | `OrderItem` |
| Details column (`fieldDetails`) | `ref orders.DomainModel.order.schemas.OrderItem` | `ref OrderItem` |
| Schema ref inside link summary | already local via `fieldLocalName` — no change | — |
| Nested field prefix (`address.street.city`) | `address.street.city` | `city` (final segment only; depth indent conveys nesting) |
| Schema section header subtitle | `orders.DomainModel.order.schemas.Order` (small mono) | unchanged — small enough to read as metadata |

The `title` attribute is set on every shortened element so the full qualified ID is visible on native hover.

### Debug mode

A toggle button lives at the **bottom of the left nav rail** (below the Dashboard/Models buttons). This is where a settings menu will eventually live; the debug toggle is a natural placeholder for it. State is persisted in `localStorage` under the key `corum:debugMode`. A subtle visual indicator (the button stays highlighted) shows debug mode is active.

When active:

- All qualified names render in full (the compact truncation is skipped)
- Full node IDs are visible as plain selectable text — no copy button needed

### What does not change

- Array/map suffixes on nested field names (`[]`, `{}`, `{[]}`) — these remain on the final segment in both modes (e.g. compact shows `items[]` not `orders.items[]`)
- Schema section header subtitle showing `schema.id` in small mono text — kept in both modes (it is small enough not to be noisy)
- Nav rail node labels — already use `displayName` (final segment); no change

## Implementation notes

- A `useDebugMode()` hook (or a simple `useState` + `localStorage` read) at the `App` level, passed down via props or a React context.
- `refName()` and `fieldType()` gain a `compact` boolean parameter (or the debug flag is threaded through). When `compact = true`, extract the final segment from a qualified ref string the same way `refLocalSchemaName` does.
- `SchemaFieldRows` passes `compact` down; when `compact = true`, the `prefix` prop is not rendered — only `name` (plus its array/map suffix) is shown in the name cell. The visual depth indent already communicates nesting.
- The nav rail toggle button sits below the existing nav items, visually separated (bottom of `NavRail`).

## Out of scope

- Keyboard shortcut for debug toggle (can be added later)
- Copy buttons — selectable text in debug mode is sufficient
- Any change to the MCP serialisation layer — this is purely a display concern
